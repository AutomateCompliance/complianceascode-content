.TH scap-security-guide 8 "26 Jan 2013" "version 1"

.SH NAME
SCAP Security Guide - Delivers security guidance, baselines, and
associated validation mechanisms utilizing the Security Content
Automation Protocol (SCAP).


.SH DESCRIPTION
The project provides practical security hardening advice
and also links it to compliance requirements in order to ease deployment
activities, such as certification and accreditation. These include requirements
in the U.S. government (Federal, Defense, and Intelligence Community) as well
as of the financial services and health care industries. For example,
high-level and widely-accepted policies such as NIST 800-53 provides prose
stating that System Administrators must audit "privileged user actions," but do
not define what "privileged actions" are. The SSG bridges the gap between
generalized policy requirements and specific implementation guidance, in SCAP
formats to support automation whenever possible.

the National Security Agency.

This baseline implements configuration requirements from the following
sources:

- NIST 800-53 control selections for Moderate-Impact systems (NIST 800-53)

For any differing configuration requirements, e.g. password lengths, the stricter
security setting was chosen. Security Requirement Traceability Guides (RTMs) and
sample System Security Configuration Guides are provided via the
scap-security-guide-docs package.

This profile reflects U.S. Government consensus content and is developed through
the ComplianceAsCode initiative, championed by the National
Security Agency. Except for differences in formatting to accommodate
publishing processes, this profile mirrors ComplianceAsCode
content as minor divergences, such as bugfixes, work through the
consensus and release processes.

This baseline implements configuration requirements from the following
sources:

- NIST 800-53 control selections for Moderate-Impact systems (NIST 800-53)

For any differing configuration requirements, e.g. password lengths, the stricter
security setting was chosen. Security Requirement Traceability Guides (RTMs) and
sample System Security Configuration Guides are provided via the
scap-security-guide-docs package.

This profile reflects U.S. Government consensus content and is developed through

supplement the basic security requirements, are taken from the security controls
in NIST Special Publication 800-53.

Development partners and sponsors include the U.S. National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST), U.S. Department of Defense,
the National Security Agency, and Red Hat.

This baseline implements configuration requirements from the following
sources:

- Committee on National Security Systems Instruction No. 1253 (CNSSI 1253)
- NIST 800-53 control selections for MODERATE impact systems (NIST 800-53)
- U.S. Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB)
- NIAP Protection Profile for Virtualization v1.0 (VPP v1.0)

For any differing configuration requirements, e.g. password lengths, the stricter
security setting was chosen. Security Requirement Traceability Guides (RTMs) and
sample System Security Configuration Guides are provided via the
scap-security-guide-docs package.

This profile reflects U.S. Government consensus content and is developed through
the ComplianceAsCode project, championed by the National
Security Agency. Except for differences in formatting to accommodate
publishing processes, this profile mirrors ComplianceAsCode
content as minor divergences, such as bugfixes, work through the

.SH DEPLOYMENT TO U.S. CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS
SCAP Security Guide content is considered vendor (Red Hat) provided content.
Per guidance from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
U.S. Government programs are allowed to use Vendor produced SCAP content in absence
of "Governmental Authority" checklists. The specific NIST verbage:

.SH DEPLOYMENT TO U.S. MILITARY SYSTEMS
DoD Directive (DoDD) 8500.1 requires that "all IA and IA-enabled IT products
incorporated into DoD information systems shall be configured in accordance
with DoD-approved security configuration guidelines" and tasks Defense
Information Systems Agency (DISA) to "develop and provide security configuration
guidance for IA and IA-enabled IT products in coordination with Director, NSA."
The output of this authority is the DISA Security Technical Implementation Guides,
or STIGs. DISA FSO is in the process of moving the STIGs towards the use
of the NIST Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) in order to "automate"
compliance reporting of the STIGs.

Through a common, shared vision, the SCAP Security Guide community enjoys
close collaboration directly with NSA, NIST, and DISA FSO. As stated in Section 1.1 of
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 STIG Overview, Version 1, Release 2, issued on 03-JUNE-2013:

"The consensus content was developed using an open-source project called SCAP
Security Guide. The project's website is https://www.open-scap.org/security-policies/scap-security-guide.
Except for differences in formatting to accomodate the DISA STIG publishing
process, the content of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 STIG should mirror the SCAP Security Guide
content with only minor divergence as updates from multiple sources work through
the consensus process."

The DoD STIG for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, revision V2R4, was released in July 2019
Currently, the DoD Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 STIG contains only XCCDF content and is
available online:
https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/?_dl_facet_stigs=operating-systems%2Cunix-linux

Content published against the public.cyber.mil website is authoritative
STIG content. The SCAP Security Guide project, as noted in the STIG overview,
is considered upstream content. Unlike DISA FSO, the SCAP Security Guide project
does publish OVAL automation content. Individual programs and C&A evaluators
make program-level determinations on the direct usage of the SCAP Security Guide.
Currently there is no blanket approval.
