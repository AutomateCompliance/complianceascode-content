description: 'The <tt>VERBOSE</tt> parameter configures the SSH daemon to record login
  and logout activity.

  To specify the log level in

  SSH, add or correct the following line in the <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> file:

  <pre>LogLevel VERBOSE</pre>'
identifiers: {}
inherited_platforms:
- machine
ocil: 'To check if LogLevel is enabled or set correctly, run the

  following command:

  <pre>$ sudo grep "^LogLevel" /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>

  If configured properly, output should be <pre>LogLevel VERBOSE</pre>'

rationale: 'SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity.
  <tt>DEBUG</tt> is specifically

  not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides

  so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information. <tt>INFO</tt>
  or

  <tt>VERBOSE</tt> level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH
  users. In many

  situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular
  user was active

  on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which
  helps narrow the

  field.'
