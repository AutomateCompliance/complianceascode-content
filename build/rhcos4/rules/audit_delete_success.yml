description: 'Ensure that successful attempts to delete a file are audited.


  The following rules configure audit as described above:

  <pre>## Successful file delete

  -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S unlink,unlinkat,rename,renameat -F success=1 -F auid&gt;=1000
  -F auid!=unset -F key=successful-delete

  -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S unlink,unlinkat,rename,renameat -F success=1 -F auid&gt;=1000
  -F auid!=unset -F key=successful-delete

  </pre>


  The <tt>Audit</tt> package provides pre-configured  rules in <tt>/usr/share/audit/sample-rules</tt>.
  The above content can be found in <tt>/usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42-4-delete-success.rules</tt>.

  To deploy this configuration, it is recommended to copy it over to the <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d/</tt>
  directory:

  <pre>

  cp /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42-4-delete-success.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/

  </pre>


  Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:

  <pre>augenrules --load</pre>


  Note: This rule utilizes a file provided by <tt>Audit</tt> package to comply with
  OSPP 4.2.1. You may reuse this rule in different profiles. If you decide to do so,
  it is recommended that you inspect contents of the file closely and make sure that
  they are alligned with your needs.'

  rules, check the content of the file with the following command:

  <pre>cat /etc/audit/rules.d/30-ospp-v42-4-delete-success.rules</pre>

  The output has to be exactly as follows:
