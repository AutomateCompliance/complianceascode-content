description: 'System time should be synchronized between all systems in an environment.
  This is

  typically done by establishing an authoritative time server or set of servers and
  having all

  systems synchronize their clocks to them.

  The <code>chrony</code> package can be installed with the following command:

  <pre></pre>'
identifiers: {}
inherited_platforms:
- machine
ocil: 'Run the following command to determine if the <code>chrony</code> package is
  installed:

  <pre>$ rpm -q chrony</pre>'
ocil_clause: the package is installed

rationale: 'Time synchronization is important to support time sensitive security mechanisms
  like

  Kerberos and also ensures log files have consistent time records across the enterprise,

  which aids in forensic investigations.'
