  (''options'' line) in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt>. If they include

  <tt>page_poison=1</tt>, then page poisoning is enabled at boot time.

  To ensure <tt>page_poison=1</tt> is configured on the installed kernel, add

rationale: 'Poisoning writes an arbitrary value to freed pages, so any modification
  or

  reference to that page after being freed or before being initialized will be

  detected and prevented.

  This prevents many types of use-after-free vulnerabilities at little performance
  cost.

  Also prevents leak of data and detection of corrupted memory.'
