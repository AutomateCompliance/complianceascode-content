title: Ensure a dedicated group owns sudo
warnings:
- functionality: 'Changing group owner of <tt>/usr/bin/sudo</tt> to a group with no
    member users will prevent

    any and all escalatation of privileges.

    Additionally, the system may become unmanageable if root logins are not allowed.'
- general: This rule doesn't come with a remediation, before remediating the sysadmin
    needs to add users to the dedicated sudo group.
