description: 'If a filesystem is exported using root squashing, requests from root
  on the client

  are considered to be unprivileged (mapped to a user such as nobody). This provides
  some mild

  protection against remote abuse of an NFS server. Root squashing is enabled by default,
  and

  should not be disabled.

  <br /><br />

  Ensure that no line in <tt>/etc/exports</tt> contains the option <tt>no_root_squash</tt>.'
