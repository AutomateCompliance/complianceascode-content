  If a line <tt>Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf</tt> is returned, then the configuration

rationale: 'This form of distributed configuration is considered as a good practice,
  and as other sshd rules assume that directives in files in the <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d</tt>
  config directory are effective, there has to be a rule that ensures this.

  Aside from that, having multiple configuration files makes the SSH Server configuration
  changes easier to partition according to the reason that they were introduced, and
  therefore it should help to perform merges of hardening updates.'
