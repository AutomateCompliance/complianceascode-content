description: 'Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms
  usage of many packages.

  BIND is supported by crypto policy, but the BIND configuration may be

  set up to ignore it.


  To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, ensure that the
  <tt>/etc/named.conf</tt>

  includes the appropriate configuration:

  In the <tt>options</tt> section of <tt>/etc/named.conf</tt>, make sure that the
  following line

  is not commented out or superseded by later includes:

  <tt>include "/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/bind.config";</tt>'
