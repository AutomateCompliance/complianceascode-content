rationale: 'These legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have

  been replaced with the more secure SSH package. Even if the server is removed,

  it is best to ensure the clients are also removed to prevent users from

  inadvertently attempting to use these commands and therefore exposing


  their credentials. Note that removing the <tt>rsh</tt> package removes


  the clients for <tt>rsh</tt>,<tt>rcp</tt>, and <tt>rlogin</tt>.'
