description: 'By removing the following packages,  the system no longer has X Windows
  installed.


  <tt>xorg-x11-server-Xorg xorg-x11-server-common xorg-x11-server-utils xorg-x11-server-Xwayland</tt>


  If X Windows is not installed then the system cannot boot into graphical user mode.

  This prevents the system from being accidentally or maliciously booted into a <tt>graphical.target</tt>

  mode. To do so, run the following command:


  <pre>sudo dnf remove xorg-x11-server-Xorg xorg-x11-server-common xorg-x11-server-utils
  xorg-x11-server-Xwayland</pre>


  Additionally, setting the system''s default target to

  <tt>multi-user.target</tt> will prevent automatic startup of the X server.

  To do so, run:

  <pre>$ systemctl set-default multi-user.target</pre>

  You should see the following output:

  <pre>Removed symlink /etc/systemd/system/default.target.

  Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/default.target to /usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.</pre>'

- functionality: 'The installation and use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) increases
    your attack vector and decreases your

    overall security posture. Removing the package xorg-x11-server-common package
    will remove the graphical target

    which might bring your system to an inconsistent state requiring additional configuration
    to access the system

    again. If a GUI is an operational requirement, a tailored profile that removes
    this rule should used before

    continuing installation.'
