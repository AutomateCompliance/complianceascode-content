description: 'By default, <tt>GNOME</tt> will allow all users to have some administratrion

  capability. This should be disabled so that non-administrative users are not making

  configuration changes. To configure the system to disable user administration

  capability in the Graphical User Interface (GUI), add or set

  <tt>user-administration-disabled</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in

  <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:

  <pre>[org/gnome/desktop/lockdown]

  user-administration-disabled=true

  </pre>

  Once the settings have been added, add a lock to

  <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.

  For example:

  <pre>/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/user-administration-disabled</pre>

  After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.'

  run the following command:

  To ensure that users cannot enable user administration, run the following:
