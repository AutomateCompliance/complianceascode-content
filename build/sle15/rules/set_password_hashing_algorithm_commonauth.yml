description: 'The PAM system service can be configured to only store encrypted

  representations of passwords. In

  <tt>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</tt>,

  the

  <tt>auth</tt> section of the file controls which PAM modules execute

  during a password change. Set the <tt>pam_unix.so</tt> module in the

  <tt>auth</tt> section to include the argument <tt>sha512</tt>, as shown

  below:

  <br />

  <pre>auth   required    pam_unix.so sha512 <i>other arguments...</i></pre>

  <br />

  This will help ensure when local users change their authentication method,

  hashes for the new authentications will be generated using the SHA-512

  algorithm. This is the default.'

rationale: 'Unapproved mechanisms used for authentication to the cryptographic module

  are not verified and therefore cannot be relied on to provide

  confidentiality or integrity, and data may be compromised.

  This setting ensures user and group account administration utilities are

  configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords.

  Additionally, the <tt>crypt_style</tt> configuration option ensures the use

  of a strong hashing algorithm that makes password cracking attacks more

  difficult.'
