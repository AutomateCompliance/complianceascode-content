description: 'The pam_cracklib module''s <tt>lcredit=</tt> parameter controls requirements

  for usage of lowercase letters in a password. When set to a negative

  number, any password will be required to contain that many lowercase

  characters. When set to a positive number, pam_cracklib will grant +1

  additional length credit for each lowercase character.

  Add <tt>lcredit=-1</tt> after pam_cracklib.so to require use of a

  lowercase character in passwords.'

ocil: 'Check that the operating system enforces password complexity by requiring

  that at least one lower-case character be used by using the following

  command:


  <pre># grep pam_cracklib.so /etc/pam.d/common-password

  password requisite pam_cracklib.so lcredit=<sub idref="var_password_pam_lcredit"
  /></pre>


  If the command does not return anything, the returned line is commented

  out, or has a second column value different from "requisite", or does not

  contain <tt>lcredit=<sub idref="var_password_pam_lcredit" /></tt>, this is a finding.


  The DoD and FISMA require at least one lowercase character in a password.

  This would appear as <tt>lcredit=-1</tt>.'
