description: 'Files containing sensitive informations should be protected by restrictive

  permissions. Most of the time, there is no need that these files need to be read
  by any non-root user


  To properly set the permissions of <code>/var/log/messages</code>, run the command:

  <pre>$ sudo chmod 0640 /var/log/messages</pre>


  Check that "permissions.local" file contains the correct permissions rules with
  the following command:


  <pre># grep -i messages /etc/permissions.local


  /var/log/messages root:root 640</pre>'

  run the command:

  <pre>$ ls -l /var/log/messages</pre>

  If properly configured, the output should indicate the following permissions:

  <code>-rw-r-----</code>


  Check that <tt>permissions.local</tt> file contains the correct permissions rules
  with the following command:


  <pre># grep -i messages /etc/permissions.local


  /var/log/messages root:root 640</pre>


  If the command does not return any or different output, this is a finding.


  Run the following command to correct the permissions after adding the missing entry:

rationale: 'The <tt>/var/log/messages</tt> file contains system error messages. Only

  authorized personnel should be aware of errors and the details of the

  errors. Error messages are an indicator of an organization''s operational

  state or can identify the SUSE operating system or platform. Additionally,

  Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and operational information must

  not be revealed through error messages to unauthorized personnel or their

  designated representatives.'
