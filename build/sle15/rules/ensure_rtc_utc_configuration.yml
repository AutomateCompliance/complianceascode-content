ocil: 'To verify that the system real-time clock is set to UTC or GMT, run the following
  command:


  <pre># timedatectl status | grep -i "time zone"</pre>

  <pre># Time zone: UTC (UTC, +0000)</pre>


  If "Timezone" is not set to UTC, this is a finding.

  Fix Text: Configure the SUSE operating system is configured to use UTC.

  To configure the system time zone to use UTC or GMT, run the following command,
  replacing [ZONE] with "UTC" or "GMT".

  <pre># sudo timedatectl set-timezone [ZONE]</pre>'

rationale: 'If time stamps are not consistently applied and there is no common

  time reference, it is difficult to perform forensic analysis.


  Time stamps generated by the operating system include date and time.

  Time is commonly expressed in UTC, a modern continuation of GMT, or

  local time with an offset from UTC.'
