description: 'The pam_cracklib module''s <tt>ucredit=</tt> parameter controls requirements

  for usage of uppercase letters in a password. When set to a negative

  number, any password will be required to contain that many uppercase

  characters. When set to a positive number, pam_cracklib will grant +1

  additional length credit for each uppercase character.

  Add <tt>ucredit=-1</tt> after pam_cracklib.so to require use of an upper

  case character in passwords.'

ocil: 'To check how many uppercase characters are required in a password, run the

  following command:

  <pre>grep pam_cracklib.so /etc/pam.d/common-password

  password requisite pam_cracklib.so ucredit=<sub idref="var_password_pam_ucredit"
  /></pre>

  The <tt>ucredit</tt> parameter (as a negative number) will indicate how

  many uppercase characters are required.

  The DoD and FISMA require at least one uppercase character in a password.

  This would appear as <tt>ucredit=-1</tt>.'
