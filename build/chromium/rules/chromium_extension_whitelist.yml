description: 'An organization might need to use an internal or third party developed
  extension. Any

  organizationally approved extenstion should be enabled. To enable approved extensions,

  set <tt>ExtensionInstallWhitelist</tt> to <tt><sub idref="var_extension_whitelist"
  /></tt>

  in the Chromium policy file.

  If there are no approved extensions, <tt>ExtensionInstallWhitelist</tt> should be
  set to

  <tt><sub idref="var_extension_whitelist" selector="default" /></tt>.'
