description: 'To set up SSH client to use entropy from a high-quality source, make
  sure

  that the appropriate shell environment variable is configured. The

  <tt>SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG</tt> environment variable determines how many bytes

  of entropy to use. Make sure that the file

  <tt>/etc/profile.d/cc-ssh-strong-rng.sh</tt> contains line

  <pre>export SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG=32</pre>.'

rationale: 'Some SSH implementations use the openssl library for entropy, which by
  default, doesn''t use high-entropy sources.

  Randomness is needed to generate considerably more secure data-encryption keys.
  Plaintext padding, initialization vectors

  in encryption algorithms, and high-quality entropy eliminates the possibility that
  the output of

  the random number generator used by SSH would be known to potential attackers.'
