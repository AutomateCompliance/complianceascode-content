description: "Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs) include Spyware, Adware, Remote\
  \ Administration Tools, Dialers, Password Crackers, Jokes, and Key Loggers. \nWhile\
  \ PUPs do not typically have any infection capability on their own, they rely on\
  \ malware or other attach mechanisms to be installed onto target hosts, \nafter\
  \ which they will collect and transfer data from the host to an external host and/or\
  \ will be used as attach mechanisms.\n\nTo check that VSEL settings are configured\
  \ correctly, you have to examine the config file\navailable under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</tt>.\n\
  If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.OAS.action.Default.primary:\
  \ Clean</tt>,\nprograms/jokes will attempted to be cleaned first, preserving the\
  \ file data."

rationale: "Configuring the anti-virus software to attempt to clean the file first\
  \ will allow for the possibility of a false positive. \nIn most cases, however,\
  \ the secondary action of delete will be used, mitigating the risk of the PUPs being\
  \ installed and used maliciously."
