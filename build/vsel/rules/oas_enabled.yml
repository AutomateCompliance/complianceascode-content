description: "For anti-virus software to be effective, it must be running at all times,\
  \ beginning from the point of the system's initial startup. \nOtherwise, the risk\
  \ is greater for viruses, Trojans, and other malware infecting the system during\
  \ that startup phase.\n\nTo check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you\
  \ have to examine the config file\navailable under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</tt>.\n\
  If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.oasEnabled: true</tt>,\nthe antivirus\
  \ software will be running at initial startup of the system."
