description: "Malware may have infected a file that is necessary to the user. By configuring\
  \ the anti-virus software to first attempt cleaning the infected file, availability\
  \ to the file is not sacrificed. \nIf a cleaning attempt is not successful, however,\
  \ deleting the file is the only safe option to ensure the malware is not introduced\
  \ onto the system or network.\n\nTo check that VSEL settings are configured correctly,\
  \ you have to examine the config file\navailable under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</tt>.\n\
  If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.OAS.action.App.primary:\
  \ Clean</tt>,\nfiles will attempted to be cleaned first, preserving the file data."
