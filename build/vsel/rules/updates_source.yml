description: "Anti-virus signature files are updated almost daily by anti-virus software\
  \ vendors. \nThese files are made available to anti-virus clients as they are published.\
  \ \nKeeping virus signature files as current as possible is vital to the security\
  \ of any system. \nThe anti-virus software product must be configured to receive\
  \ those updates automatically in order to afford the expected protection.\n\nTo\
  \ check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, connect to the McAfee VirusScan\
  \ Enterprise for Linux (VSEL) Monitor (WEB interface) \nof the Linux system being\
  \ reviewed from a desktop browser window and logon with the nails user account.\n\
  \nIn the VSEL WEB Monitor, under <tt>Configure</tt>, select <tt>Repositories</tt>.\n\
  Under <tt>Repository List</tt>, verify all repositories listed point to a local\
  \ or DoD-managed repository.\n\nIf all repositories listed do not point to local\
  \ or DoD-managed repository, this is a finding."

rationale: "While obtaining updates, patches, service packs and updates from the vendor\
  \ are timelier, \nthe possibility of corruption or malware being introduced to the\
  \ system is higher. \nBy obtaining these from an official DoD source and/or downloading\
  \ them to a separate system \nfirst and validating them before making them available\
  \ to systems, the possibility of \nmalware being introduced is mitigated."
