description: 'It is imperative to protect Linux systems from malware introduced from
  those other network systems by either ensuring the remote systems are protected
  or by scanning files from those systems when they are accessed.


  To check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config
  file

  available under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</tt>.

  If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.OAS.scanNWFiles: true</tt>,

  files on network mounts are scanned.'
