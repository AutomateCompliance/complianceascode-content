description: 'The SSH server service, sshd, is commonly needed.

  However, if it can be disabled, do so.



  The <code>sshd</code> service can be disabled with the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask --now sshd.service</pre>


  This is unusual, as SSH is a common method for encrypted and authenticated

  remote access.'
