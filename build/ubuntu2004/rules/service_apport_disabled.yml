description: 'The Apport modifies certain kernel configuration values at

  runtime which may decrease the overall security of the system and expose sensitive
  data.


  The <code>apport</code> service can be disabled with the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask --now apport.service</pre>'

rationale: 'The Apport service modifies the kernel

  <tt>fs.suid_dumpable</tt> configuration at runtime which

  prevents other hardening from being persistent. Disabling the

  service prevents this behavior.'
