description: '

  By removing the <tt>gdm3</tt> package, the system no longer has GNOME installed


  installed. If X Windows is not installed then the system cannot boot into graphical
  user mode.

  This prevents the system from being accidentally or maliciously booted into a <tt>graphical.target</tt>

  mode. To do so, run the following command:


  <pre>$ sudo apt remove gdm3</pre>'
identifiers: {}
inherited_platforms:
- gdm
ocil: 'To ensure the gdm3 package group is removed, run the following command:

  <pre>$ dpkg -l gdm3</pre>

  The output should begin with:

  <pre>rc gdm3</pre>

  Or

  <pre>dpkg-query: no packages found matching gdm3</pre>'
ocil_clause: gdm3 has not been removed

rationale: 'Unnecessary service packages must not be installed to decrease the attack
  surface of the system.

  A graphical environment is unnecessary for certain types of systems including a
  virtualization

  hypervisor.'
