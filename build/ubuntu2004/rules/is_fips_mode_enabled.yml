rationale: 'Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes
  of utilizing encryption to

  protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering
  to the higher

  standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they
  have been tested

  and validated.'

- general: "To configure the OS to run in FIPS 140-2 mode, the kernel parameter \"\

- regulatory: 'System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes

    FIPS-140 certifications.

    FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use

    cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information

    in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as

    defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform

    Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in

    designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal

    departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under

    contract. See <b>

    <a xmlns=''http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'' href=''https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf''>https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf</a></b>

    To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by

    a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing

    documentation, test results, design information, and independent third

    party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is

    capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor

    submits to this process.'
