description: 'Any operating system providing too much information in error messages

  risks compromising the data and security of the structure, and content

  of error messages needs to be carefully considered by the organization.


  Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages.

  The extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle

  error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational

  requirements. Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes,

  for example, erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake

  as the username, mission/business information that can be derived from

  (if not stated explicitly by) information recorded, and personal

  information, such as account numbers, social security numbers, and credit

  card numbers.'
