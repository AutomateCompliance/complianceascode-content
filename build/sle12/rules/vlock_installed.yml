rationale: 'A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and

  moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information

  system but does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of

  the absence.


  The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can

  be determined.


  Regardless of where the session lock is determined and implemented,

  once invoked, the session lock must remain in place until the user

  reauthenticates. No other activity aside from reauthentication must

  unlock the system.'
