description: 'To configure the system to introduce a delay after failed logon attempts,

  add or correct the <tt>pam_faildelay</tt> settings in

  <tt>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</tt> to make sure its <tt>delay</tt> parameter

  is at least <sub idref="var_password_pam_delay" /> or greater. For example:

  <pre>auth required pam_faildelay.so delay=<sub idref="var_password_pam_delay" /></pre>'

ocil: 'Verify that the SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 operating system enforces a minimum
  delay betweeen

  logon prompts following a failed logon attempt.


  <pre># grep pam_faildelay /etc/pam.d/common-auth

  auth required pam_faildelay.so delay=<sub idref="var_password_pam_delay" /></pre>


  If the value of delay is not set to

  <tt><sub idref="var_password_pam_delay" /></tt> or greater,

  "delay" is commented out, "delay" is missing, or the "pam_faildelay" line is missing

  completely, this is a finding.'
