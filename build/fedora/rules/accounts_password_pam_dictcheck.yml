rationale: 'Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
  to compromise the password.

  Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password
  in resisting attempts at

  guessing and brute-force attacks.

  <br /><br />

  Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to
  crack a password. The more

  complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need
  to be tested before the

  password is compromised.

  <br /><br />

  Passwords with dictionary words may be more vulnerable to password-guessing attacks.'
