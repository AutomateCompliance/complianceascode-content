rationale: 'Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux kernel and a number
  of utilities

  with enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access controls to
  Linux.

  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new architectural components originally

  developed to improve security of the Flask operating system. These architectural
  components

  provide general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access control

  policies, including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement, Role-based
  Access

  Control, and Multi-level Security.


  <tt>policycoreutils</tt> contains the policy core utilities that are required for

  basic operation of an SELinux-enabled system. These utilities include <tt>load_policy</tt>

  to load SELinux policies, <tt>setfiles</tt> to label filesystems, <tt>newrole</tt>
  to

  switch roles, and so on.'
