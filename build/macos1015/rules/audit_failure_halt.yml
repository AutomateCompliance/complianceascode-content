rationale: "The audit service should shut down the computer if it \nis unable to audit\
  \ system events. Once audit failure\noccurs, user and system activity is no longer\
  \ recorded\nand malicious activity could go undetected. Audit\nprocessing failures\
  \ include software/hardware errors,\nfailures in the audit capturing mechanisms,\
  \ and audit\nstorage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses\nto audit failure\
  \ depend on the nature of the failure\nmode."
