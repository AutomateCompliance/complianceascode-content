description: 'Production environments should exercise disaster

  recovery procedures that include provisions for the JBoss

  platform, deployed applications, and any required source code

  at least annually. Environments requiring higher assurances

  of disaster recovery ability should test procedures more

  often, possibly quarterly or even monthly.'
