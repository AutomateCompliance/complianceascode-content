rationale: 'In order to limit access in the event of an exploitation of the Jboss
  or

  one of its deployed applications, the account owning the Jboss process should

  be limited in its ability to interact with the supporting operating system

  where possible. Thus, the JBoss process owner account should not have

  interactive console access.'
