rationale: "The server auditing capability is critical for accurate\nforensic analysis.\
  \ Alerting administrators when audit log\nsize thresholds are exceeded helps ensure\
  \ the administrators\ncan respond to heavy activity in a timely manner. Failure\
  \ to\nalert increases the probability that an adversary's actions\nwill go undetected.\_\
  The server or the configured Network\nAttached Storage Device (SAN) must alert administrators\n\
  when audit log usage reaches a defined percentage of overall\ncapacity."
