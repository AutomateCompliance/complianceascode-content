  brute force

  attack. Identity tokens are sensitive and need to be protected with a stronger

  hashing algorithm to prevent unauthorized disclosure and subsequent access.

  Pass: If value of parameter hash_algorithm under [token] section in

  /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/keystone/etc/keystone/keystone.conf is set
