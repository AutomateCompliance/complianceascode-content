rationale: 'Certificates may be revoked due to improper issuance, compromise of the
  certificate,

  and failure to adhere to policy. Therefore, any certificate found on a CRL

  should not be trusted. Permitting execution of an applet published with a

  revoked certificate may result in spoofing, malware, system modification,

  invasion of privacy, and denial of service.'
