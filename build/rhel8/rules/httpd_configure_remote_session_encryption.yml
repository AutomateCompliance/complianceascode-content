rationale: 'Logging into a web server remotely using an unencrypted protocol or service

  when performing updates and maintenance is a major risk. Data, such as user

  account, is transmitted in plaintext and can easily be compromised. When

  performing remote administrative tasks, a protocol or service that encrypts the

  communication channel must be used.

  <br /><br />

  An alternative to remote administration of

  the web server is to perform web server administration locally at the console.

  Local administration at the console implies physical access to the server.'
