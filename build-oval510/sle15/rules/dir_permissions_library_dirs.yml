description: 'System-wide shared library directories, which contain are linked to
  executables

  during process load time or run time, are stored in the following directories

  by default:

  <pre>/lib

  /lib64

  /usr/lib

  /usr/lib64

  </pre>

  Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are

  stored in <tt>/lib/modules</tt>. All sub-directories in these directories

  should not be group-writable or world-writable. If any file in these

  directories is found to be group-writable or world-writable, correct

  its permission with the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo chmod go-w <i>DIR</i></pre>'

rationale: 'If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to software
  libraries,

  then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing

  and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.


  This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries that are accessible

  and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also
  include

  privileged programs which execute with escalated privileges. Only qualified and
  authorized

  individuals must be allowed to obtain access to information system components for
  purposes

  of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.'
