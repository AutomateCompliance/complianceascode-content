description: 'The audit system should collect unsuccessful file deletion

  attempts for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured

  to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon

  startup (the default), add the following lines to a file with suffix

  <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>.

  If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

  utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to

  <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file.

  <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S renameat2 -F exit=-EACCES -F auid&gt;=1000 -F
  auid!=unset -F key=unsuccessful-delete

  -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S renameat2 -F exit=-EPERM -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
  -F key=unsuccessful-delete</pre>

  If the system is 64 bit then also add the following lines:

  <pre>

  -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S renameat2 -F exit=-EACCES -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
  -F key=unsuccessful-delete

  -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S renameat2 -F exit=-EPERM -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
  -F key=unsuccessful-delete</pre>'
