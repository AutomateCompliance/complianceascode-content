  do not have a valid user, or assign a valid user to all unowned

  files and directories. To assign a valid owner to a local

  interactive user''s files and directories, use the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo chown -R <i>USER</i> /home/<i>USER</i></pre>'

rationale: 'If local interactive users do not own the files in their directories,

  unauthorized users may be able to access them. Additionally, if files are not

  owned by the user, this could be an indication of system compromise.'
