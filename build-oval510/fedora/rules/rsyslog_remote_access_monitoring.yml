description: 'Logging of remote access methods must be implemented to help identify
  cyber

  attacks and ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies are being

  audited and upheld. An examples of a remote access method is the use of the

  Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) from an external, non-organization controlled

  network. The <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> or

  <tt>/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf</tt> file should contain a match for the following

  selectors: <tt>auth.*</tt>, <tt>authpriv.*</tt>, and <tt>daemon.*</tt>. If

  not, use the following as an example configuration:

  <pre>auth.*;authpriv.*;daemon.*                              /var/log/secure</pre>'

  run the following command:

  <pre>grep -rE ''(auth.\*|authpriv.\*|daemon.\*)'' /etc/rsyslog.*</pre>

  The output should contain <tt>auth.*</tt>, <tt>authpriv.*</tt>, and <tt>daemon.*</tt>

  pointing to a log file.'
