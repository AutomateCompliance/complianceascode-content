description: "chrony is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP).\
  \ It is designed to\nsynchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use\
  \ a source that is highly\naccurate. More information on chrony can be found at\n\
  \n    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' href='http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/'>http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/</a>.\n\
  Chrony can be configured to be a client and/or a server.\nTo ensure that chronyd\
  \ is running under chrony user account, Add or edit the\n<tt>OPTIONS</tt> variable\
  \ in <tt>/etc/sysconfig/chronyd</tt> to include <tt>-u chrony</tt>:\n<pre>OPTIONS=\"\
  -u chrony\"</pre>\nThis recommendation only applies if chrony is in use on the system."
