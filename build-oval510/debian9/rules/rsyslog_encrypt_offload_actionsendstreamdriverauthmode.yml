description: 'Rsyslogd is a system utility providing support for message logging.
  Support

  for both internet and UNIX domain sockets enables this utility to support both local

  and remote logging.  Couple this utility with <tt>gnutls</tt> (which is a secure
  communications

  library implementing the SSL, TLS and DTLS protocols), and you have a method to
  securely

  encrypt and off-load auditing.


  When using <tt>rsyslogd</tt> to off-load logs the remote system must be authenticated.'
