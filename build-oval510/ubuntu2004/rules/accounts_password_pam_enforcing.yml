description: 'Verify that the operating system uses "pwquality" to enforce the

  password complexity rules.


  Verify the pwquality module is being enforced by operating system by

  running the following command:

  <pre>

  $ grep -i enforcing /etc/security/pwquality.conf

  enforcing = 1

  </pre>


  If the value of "enforcing" is not "1" or the line is commented out,

  this is a finding.'

rationale: 'Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources

  required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength,

  is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at

  guessing and brute-force attacks. Using enforcing=1 ensures "pwquality"

  enforces complex password construction configuration and has the ability

  to limit brute-force attacks on the system.'
