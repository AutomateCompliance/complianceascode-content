description: 'System-wide shared library files, which are linked to executables

  during process load time or run time, are stored in the following directories

  by default:

  <pre>/lib

  /lib64

  /usr/lib

  /usr/lib64

  </pre>

  Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are also

  stored in <tt>/lib/modules</tt>. All files in these directories should be

  owned by the <tt>root</tt> user. If the  directories, is found to be owned

  by a user other than root correct its

  ownership with the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo chown root <i>DIR</i></pre>'
