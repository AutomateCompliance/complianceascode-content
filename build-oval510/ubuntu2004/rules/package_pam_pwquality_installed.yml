rationale: 'Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required

  to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure

  of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and

  brute-force attacks. "pwquality" enforces complex password construction

  configuration and has the ability to limit brute-force attacks on the

  system.'
