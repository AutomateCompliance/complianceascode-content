ocil: 'Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an

  authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an

  external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods

  include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.


  This requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the

  function of the device or has the concept of an organizational user (e.g.,

  VPN, proxy capability). This does not apply to authentication for the

  purpose of configuring the device itself (management).


  Check that the <tt>pam_pkcs11.so</tt> option is configured in the

  <tt>etc/pam.d/common-auth</tt> file with the following command:


  <pre># grep pam_pkcs11.so /etc/pam.d/common-auth


  auth sufficient pam_pkcs11.so</pre>


  If <tt>pam_pkcs11.so</tt> is not set in <tt>etc/pam.d/common-auth</tt> this

rationale: 'Smart card login provides two-factor authentication stronger than

  that provided by a username and password combination. Smart cards leverage PKI

  (public key infrastructure) in order to provide and verify credentials.


  Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate

  from the information system, ensures that even if the information system is

  compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the

  authentication device.


  Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information

  systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing

  time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the

  U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common

  Access Card.'
