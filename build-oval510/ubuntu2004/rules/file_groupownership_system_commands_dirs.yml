description: 'System commands files are stored in the following directories by default:

  <pre>/bin

  /sbin

  /usr/bin

  /usr/sbin

  /usr/local/bin

  All files in these directories should be owned by the <tt>root</tt> group.

  If the directory, or any file in these directories, is found to be owned

  by a group other than root correct its ownership with the following command:

rationale: 'If the operating system allows any user to make changes to software

  libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the

  appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management

  process.

  This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries

  that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages.

  Software libraries also include privileged programs which execute with

  escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be

  allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes

  of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.'
