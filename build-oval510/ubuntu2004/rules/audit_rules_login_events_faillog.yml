description: 'The audit system already collects login information for all users

  and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the

  <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the

  default), add the following lines to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the

  directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt> in order to watch for attempted manual

  edits of files involved in storing logon events:

  <pre>-w /var/log/faillog -p wa -k logins</pre>

  If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

  utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to

  <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file in order to watch for unattempted manual

  edits of files involved in storing logon events:

  <pre>-w /var/log/faillog -p wa -k logins</pre>'
