rationale: 'If a local interactive user has a home directory defined that does not
  exist,

  the user may be given access to the / directory as the current working directory

  upon logon. This could create a Denial of Service because the user would not be

  able to access their logon configuration files, and it may give them visibility

  to system files they normally would not be able to access.'
