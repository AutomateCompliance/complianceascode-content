description: 'Server Side Includes provide a method of dynamically generating web
  pages through the

  insertion of server-side code. However, the technology is also deprecated and

  introduces significant security concerns.

  If this functionality is unnecessary, comment out the related module:

  <pre>#LoadModule include_module modules/mod_include.so</pre>

  If there is a critical need for Server Side Includes, they should be enabled with
  the

  option <tt>IncludesNoExec</tt> to prevent arbitrary code execution. Additionally,
  user

  supplied data should be encoded to prevent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.'
