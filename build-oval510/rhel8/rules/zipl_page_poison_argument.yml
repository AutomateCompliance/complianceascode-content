description: 'To enable poisoning of free pages,

  check that all boot entries in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> have <tt>page_poison=1</tt>

  included in its options.<br />

  To ensure that new kernels and boot entries continue to enable page poisoning,

  add <tt>page_poison=1</tt> to <tt>/etc/kernel/cmdline</tt>.'

  with following command:

rationale: 'Poisoning writes an arbitrary value to freed pages, so any modification
  or

  reference to that page after being freed or before being initialized will be

  detected and prevented.

  This prevents many types of use-after-free vulnerabilities at little performance
  cost.

  Also prevents leak of data and detection of corrupted memory.'
