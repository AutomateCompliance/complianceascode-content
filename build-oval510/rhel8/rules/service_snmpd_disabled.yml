description: '

  The <code>snmpd</code> service can be disabled with the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask --now snmpd.service</pre>'
identifiers:
  cce: CCE-82758-4
inherited_platforms: []
ocil: '

  To check that the <code>snmpd</code> service is disabled in system boot configuration,

  run the following command:

  <pre>$ systemctl is-enabled <code>snmpd</code></pre>

  Output should indicate the <code>snmpd</code> service has either not been installed,

  or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:

  <pre>$ systemctl is-enabled <code>snmpd</code><br/> disabled</pre>


  Run the following command to verify <code>snmpd</code> is not active (i.e. not running)
  through current runtime configuration:

  <pre>$ systemctl is-active snmpd</pre>


  If the service is not running the command will return the following output:

  <pre>inactive</pre>


  The service will also be masked, to check that the <code>snmpd</code> is masked,
  run the following command:

  <pre>$ systemctl show <code>snmpd</code> | grep "LoadState\|UnitFileState"</pre>


  If the service is masked the command will return the following outputs:


  <pre>LoadState=masked</pre>


  <pre>UnitFileState=masked</pre>'
