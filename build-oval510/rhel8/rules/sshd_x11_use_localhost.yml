rationale: 'When X11 forwarding is enabled, there may be additional exposure to the

  server and client displays if the sshd proxy display is configured to listen

  on the wildcard address. By default, sshd binds the forwarding server to the

  loopback address and sets the hostname part of the <tt>DISPLAY</tt>

  environment variable to localhost. This prevents remote hosts from

  connecting to the proxy display.  '
