rationale: 'Without the capability to restrict the roles and individuals that can
  select which events

  are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able to prevent the auditing of critical

  events. Misconfigured audits may degrade the system''s performance by overwhelming

  the audit log. Misconfigured audits may also make it more difficult to establish,

  correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify

  those responsible for one.'
