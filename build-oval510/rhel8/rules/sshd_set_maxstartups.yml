description: 'The MaxStartups parameter specifies the maximum number of concurrent

  unauthenticated connections to the SSH daemon. Additional connections will be

  dropped until authentication succeeds or the LoginGraceTime expires for a

  connection. To confgure MaxStartups, you should add or correct the following

  line in the

  <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> file:

  <pre>MaxStartups <sub idref="var_sshd_set_maxstartups" /></pre>

  CIS recommends a MaxStartups value of ''10:30:60'', or more restrictive where

  dictated by site policy.'
