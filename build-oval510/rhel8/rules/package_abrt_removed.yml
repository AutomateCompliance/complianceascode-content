description: 'The Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (<tt>abrt</tt>) collects

  and reports crash data when an application crash is detected. Using a variety

  reports to files, or forward crash reports to a centralized issue tracking

  system such as RHTSupport.

  The <code>abrt</code> package can be removed with the following command:

  <pre>

  $ sudo yum erase abrt</pre>'
