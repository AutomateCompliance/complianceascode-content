  usage of many packages.

  OpenSSH is supported by system crypto policy, but the OpenSSH configuration may
  be

  set up incorrectly.


  To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, ensure that

  <tt>/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config</tt> contains the following

  line and is not commented out:

  <tt>MACs hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256</tt>'

title: 'Configure SSH Client to Use FIPS 140-2 Validated MACs: openssh.config'
warnings:
- general: The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
- regulatory: 'System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes

    FIPS-140 certifications.

    FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use

    cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information

    in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as

    defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform

    Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in

    designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal

    departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under

    contract. See <b>

    <a xmlns=''http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'' href=''https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf''>https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf</a></b>

    To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by

    a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing

    documentation, test results, design information, and independent third

    party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is

    capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor

    submits to this process.'
