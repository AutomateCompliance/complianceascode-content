description: 'To set the runtime status of the <code>kernel.core_pattern</code> kernel
  parameter, run the following command: <pre>$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.core_pattern=|/bin/false</pre>

ocil: "The runtime status of the <code>kernel.core_pattern</code> kernel parameter\
  \ can be queried\nby running the following command:\n<pre>$ sysctl kernel.core_pattern</pre>\n\
  The output of the command should indicate a value of <code>|/bin/false</code>.\n\
  The preferable way how to assure the runtime compliance is to have\ncorrect persistent\

  \ is performed by specifying the appropriate\nassignment in any file located in\

  \ incorrect configuration by executing the following command:\n<pre>$ grep -r '^\\\
  s*kernel.core_pattern\\s*=' /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d</pre>\nIf any assignments\
  \ other than\n<pre>kernel.core_pattern = |/bin/false</pre>\nare found, or the correct\
  \ assignment is duplicated, remove those offending lines from respective files,\n\
  and make sure that exactly one file in \n<code>/etc/sysctl.d</code> contains <code>kernel.core_pattern\

  \ -r kernel.core_pattern /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d</pre>\nis executed.\n"
