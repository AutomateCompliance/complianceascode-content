description: 'To set up SSH server to use entropy from a high-quality source, edit
  the <tt>/etc/sysconfig/sshd</tt> file.

  The <tt>SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG</tt> configuration value determines how many bytes of
  entropy to use, so

  make sure that the file contains line

  <pre>SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG=32</pre>'

ocil: 'To determine whether the SSH service is configured to use strong entropy seed,

  run <pre>$ sudo grep SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG /etc/sysconfig/sshd</pre>

  If a line indicating that SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG is set to 32 is returned,

  then the option is set correctly.'

rationale: 'SSH implementation in RHEL8 uses the openssl library, which doesn''t use
  high-entropy sources by default.

  Randomness is needed to generate data-encryption keys, and as plaintext padding
  and initialization vectors

  in encryption algorithms, and high-quality entropy elliminates the possibility that
  the output of

  the random number generator used by SSH would be known to potential attackers.'

title: SSH server uses strong entropy to seed
warnings:
- general: This setting can cause problems on computers without the hardware random
    generator, because insufficient entropy causes the connection to be blocked until
    enough entropy is available.
