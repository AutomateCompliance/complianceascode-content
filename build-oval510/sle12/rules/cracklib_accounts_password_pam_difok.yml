description: 'The pam_cracklib module''s <tt>difok</tt> parameter controls requirements
  for

  usage of different characters during a password change. The number of

  changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to

  the total number of positions in the current password. In other words,

  characters may be the same within the two passwords; however, the positions

  of the like characters must be different.

  Make sure the <tt>difok</tt> parameter for the pam_cracklib module is

  configured to greater than or equal to <tt><sub idref="var_password_pam_difok" /></tt>.'

ocil: 'To check how many characters must differ during a password change, run the

  following command:

  <pre># grep pam_cracklib.so /etc/pam.d/common-password

  password requisite pam_cracklib.so difok=<sub idref="var_password_pam_difok" /></pre>

  The <tt>difok</tt> parameter will indicate how many characters must differ.

  The DoD requires at least eight characters differ during a password change.

  This would appear as <tt>difok=8</tt>.'

rationale: 'Requiring a minimum number of different characters during password changes

  ensures that newly changed passwords should not resemble previously

  compromised ones. Note that passwords which are changed on compromised

  systems will still be compromised, however.'
