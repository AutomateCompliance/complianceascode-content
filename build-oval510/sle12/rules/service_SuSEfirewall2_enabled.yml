rationale: 'To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of

  information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types

  within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or

  unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.


  SUSE operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions

  and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may

  not be necessary to support essential organizational operations.

  Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from

  a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk

  over limiting the services provided by any one component.'
