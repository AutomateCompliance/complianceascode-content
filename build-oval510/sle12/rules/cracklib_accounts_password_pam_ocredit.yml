description: 'The pam_cracklib module''s <tt>ocredit=</tt> parameter controls requirements

  for usage of special (or ``other'''') characters in a password. When set to a

  negative number, any password will be required to contain that many special

  characters. When set to a positive number, pam_cracklib will grant +1

  additional length credit for each special character.

  Make sure the <tt>ocredit</tt> parameter for the pam_cracklib module is

  set to less than or equal to <tt><sub idref="var_password_pam_ocredit" /></tt>.
  For example, <tt>ocredit=<sub idref="var_password_pam_ocredit" /></tt>.'

ocil: 'To check how many special characters are required in a password, run the

  following command:

  <pre># grep pam_cracklib.so /etc/pam.d/common-password

  password requisite pam_cracklib.so ocredit=<sub idref="var_password_pam_ocredit"
  /></pre>

  The <tt>ocredit</tt> parameter (as a negative number) will indicate how

  many special characters are required.

  The DoD and FISMA require at least one special character in a password.

  This would appear as <tt>ocredit=-1</tt>.'
