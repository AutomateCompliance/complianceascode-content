description: 'The pam_cracklib module''s <tt>dcredit</tt> parameter controls requirements

  for usage of digits in a password. When set to a negative number, any

  password will be required to contain that many digits. When set to a

  positive number, pam_cracklib will grant +1 additional length credit for

  each digit. Add <tt>dcredit=-1</tt> after pam_cracklib.so to require use of

  a digit in passwords.'

ocil: 'To check how many digits are required in a password, run the following

  command:

  <pre># grep pam_cracklib /etc/pam.d/common-password

  password requisite pam_cracklib.so dcredit=<sub idref="var_password_pam_dcredit"
  /></pre>

  The <tt>dcredit</tt> parameter (as a negative number) will indicate how

  many digits are required.

  The DoD requires at least one digit in a password.

  This would appear as <tt>dcredit=-1</tt>.'
