  \ for\nminimum characters required in a password. Add <tt>minlen=<sub idref=\"var_password_pam_minlen\"\

rationale: 'Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine

  strength and how long it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in

  a password helps to exponentially increase the time and/or resources

  required to compromise the password.'
