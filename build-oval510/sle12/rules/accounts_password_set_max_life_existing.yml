  to 60 days by running the following command for each user:

rationale: 'Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore,

  passwords need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does

  not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their

  passwords, there is the risk that the operating system passwords could be

  compromised.'
