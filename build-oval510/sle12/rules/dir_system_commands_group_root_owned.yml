rationale: "If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to \nsoftware\
  \ libraries, then those changes might be implemented without \nundergoing the appropriate\
  \ testing and approvals that are part of a \nrobust change management process.\n\
  \nThis requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries\nthat are\
  \ accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. \nSoftware\
  \ libraries also include privileged programs which execute with escalated \nprivileges.\
  \ Only qualified and authorized individuals must be allowed to obtain \naccess to\
  \ information system components for purposes of initiating changes, \nincluding\
  \ upgrades and modifications."
