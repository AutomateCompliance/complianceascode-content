description: 'The sudo command allows a user to execute programs with elevated

  (administrator) privileges. It prompts the user for their password

  and confirms your request to execute a command by checking a file,

  called sudoers.

  Restrict privileged actions by removing the following entries from the sudoers file:

  <tt>ALL ALL=(ALL) ALL</tt>

  <tt>ALL ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL</tt>'
