description: 'It is recommended that the <tt>/boot</tt> directory resides on a separate

  partition. This makes it easier to apply restrictions e.g. through the

  <tt>noexec</tt> mount option. Eventually, the <tt>/boot</tt> partition can

  be configured not to be mounted automatically with the <tt>noauto</tt> mount

  option.'
