description: "Interpreted viruses are executed by an application. Within this subcategory,\
  \ macro viruses take advantage of the capabilities of \napplications' macro programming\
  \ language to infect application documents and document templates, while scripting\
  \ viruses infect \nscripts that are understood by scripting languages processed\
  \ by services on the OS.  \n\nTo check that VSEL settings are configured correctly,\
  \ you have to examine the config file\navailable under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/ods.cfg</tt>.\n\
  If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.ODS.macroAnalysis: true</tt>,\n\
  unknown macro viruses will be scanned."

rationale: 'Many attackers use toolkits containing several different types of utilities
  and scripts that can be used to probe and attack hosts.

  Scanning for unknown macro viruses will mitigate zero-day attacks.'
