description: "The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux software runs its processes\
  \ under the nails user, which is part of the nailsgroup group. \nThe WEB GUI is\
  \ also accessed using the nails user. \n\nTo check that nails and nailsgroup are\
  \ configured correctly, access the Linux system console command line as root.\n\
  Execute the following commands. This command will pipe the results to text files\
  \ for easier review. \n\n<tt>find / -group nailsgroup >nailsgroup.txt</tt>\n<tt>find\
  \ / -user nails >nails.txt</tt>\n\nExecute the following commands to individually\
  \ review each of the text files of results, pressing space bar to move to each page\
  \ \nuntil the end of the exported text. \n\n<tt>more nailsgroup.txt</tt>\n<tt>more\
  \ nails.txt</tt>\n\nWhen reviewing the results, verify the nailsgroup group and\
  \ nails user only own the following paths.\nThe following paths assume an INSTALLDIR\
  \ of <tt>/opt/NAI/LinuxShield</tt> and a RUNTIMEDIR of <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield</tt>.\
  \ \nIf alternative folders were used, replace the following paths accordingly when\
  \ validating.\n\n<tt>/var/opt/NAI</tt> and sub-folders\n<tt>/opt/NAI</tt> and sub-folders\n\
  <tt>/McAfee/lib</tt>\n<tt>/var/spool/mail/nails</tt>\n<tt>/proc/#####</tt> (where\
  \ ##### represents the various process IDs for the VSEL processes.)\n\nIf any other\
  \ folder is owned by either the nailsgroup group or the nails user, this is a finding."

rationale: "Ensuring the nails user/nailsgroup group only has access to the required\
