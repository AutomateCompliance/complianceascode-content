description: "When scanning for malware, excluding specific file types will increase\
  \ the risk of a malware-infected file going undetected. By configuring anti-virus\
  \ software to scan all file types, the scanner has a higher success rate at detecting\
  \ and eradicating malware.\n\nTo check that VSEL settings are configured correctly,\
  \ you have to examine the config file\navailable under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/ods.cfg</tt>.\n\
  If this config file contains a line with \"extensions.mode\" with values set to\
  \ anything other than <tt>extensions.mode: all</tt>, \nassociated scans may ignore\
  \ certain file extensions."
