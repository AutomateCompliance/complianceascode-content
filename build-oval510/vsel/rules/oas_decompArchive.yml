description: "Malware can be hidden within archived files and passed from system to\
  \ system undetected unless the archive is decompressed and each file scanned. \n\
  By disabling the archive scanning capability, archives such as .tar and .tgz files\
  \ will not be decompressed and any infected files in the archives would go undetected.\
  \ \n\nTo check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you have to examine\
  \ the config file\navailable under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</tt>.\n\
  If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.OAS.decompArchive: true</tt>,\n\
  compressed archives will be decompressed before being scanned."

rationale: Decompression can slow performance, however; any virus-infected file inside
  an archive cannot become active until it has been extracted.
