description: "Due to the ability of malware to mutate after infection, standard anti-virus\
  \ signatures may not be able to catch new strains or variants of the malware. \n\
  Typically, these strains and variants will share unique characteristics with others\
  \ in their virus family.  \n\nTo check that VSEL settings are configured correctly,\
  \ you have to examine the config file\navailable under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/ods.cfg</tt>.\n\
  If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.ODS.heuristicAnalysis:\
  \ true</tt>,\nunknown virus programs will be scanned."

rationale: "By using a generic signature to detect the shared characteristics, using\
  \ wildcards where differences lie, the generic signature can detect viruses \neven\
  \ if they are padded with extra, meaningless code. This method of detection is Heuristic\
