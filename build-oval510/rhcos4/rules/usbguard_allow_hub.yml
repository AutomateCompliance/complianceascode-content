title: Authorize USB hubs in USBGuard daemon
warnings:
- general: This rule should be understood primarily as a convenience administration
    feature. This rule ensures that if the USBGuard default rules.conf file is present,
    it will alter it so that USB hub devices are allowed. However, if the rules.conf
    file is altered by system administrator, the rule does not check if USB hub devices
    are allowed. This assumes that an administrator modified the file with some purpose
    in mind.
