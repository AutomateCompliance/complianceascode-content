title: Authorize Human Interface Devices and USB hubs in USBGuard daemon
warnings:
- general: This rule should be understood primarily as a convenience administration
    feature. This rule ensures that if the USBGuard default rules.conf file is present,
    it will alter it so that USB human interface devices and hubs are allowed. However,
    if the rules.conf file is altered by system administrator, the rule does not check
    if USB human interface devices and hubs are allowed. This assumes that an administrator
    modified the file with some purpose in mind.
