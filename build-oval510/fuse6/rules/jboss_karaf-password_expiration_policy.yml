rationale: 'In combination with password length and complexity, regularly changing

  passwords can defeat many attacks. If a password or password hash is

  intercepted by a malicious party, changing the password can remove access

  or render invalid a cracking attempt on the hash. However, there are risks

  associated with frequently changing passwords. Users may take steps to

  circumvent policy such as using repetitive passwords or using password

  derivatives. Additionally, changing passwords for system or application

  accounts introduces an element of configuration risk. Poorly coordinated

  or documented changes can result in system outages or create other problems.'
