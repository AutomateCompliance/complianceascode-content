description: 'Deployed applications must not be granted any socket permissions.

  These permissions are enforced by the Java Security Manager and the policies

  it loads at startup. These permissions can be assigned or restricted in an

  application-specific, granular manner.'

rationale: 'Java permissions for deployed applications should be carefully restricted

  to enforce the least privilege principle. Most well-designed applications

  will not need to directly manipulate sockets for network access (access to

  datasources should be handled through datasources, which can be

  assigned SocketPermission.'
