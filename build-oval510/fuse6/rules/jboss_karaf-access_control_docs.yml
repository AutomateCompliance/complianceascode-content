rationale: 'A consistent, cohesive access control policy is impossible to attain

  without a well-documented access control policy and related procedures.

  Failure to do so typically results in over-assignment of access

  permissions for users and applications, stale access for users and

  applications, and other access control misconfigurations that reduce

  the effectiveness of the security policy.'
