description: 'The <tt>status</tt> module provides real-time access to statistics on
  the internal operation of

  the web server. This may constitute an unnecessary information leak and should be
  disabled

  unless necessary. To do so, comment out the related module:

  <pre>#LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so</pre>

  If there is a critical need for this module, ensure that access to the status

  page is properly restricted to a limited set of hosts in the status handler

  configuration.'
