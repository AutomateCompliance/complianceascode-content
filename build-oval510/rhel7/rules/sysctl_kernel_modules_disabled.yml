rationale: 'Malicious kernel modules can have a significant impact on system security
  and

  availability. Disabling loading of kernel modules prevents this threat. Note

  that once this option has been set, it cannot be reverted without doing a

  system reboot. Make sure that all needed kernel modules are loaded before

  setting this option.'
