description: 'To set the runtime status of the <code>vm.mmap_min_addr</code> kernel
  parameter, run the following command: <pre>$ sudo sysctl -w vm.mmap_min_addr=65536</pre>

  To make sure that the setting is persistent, add the following line to a file in

rationale: 'The <tt>vm.mmap_min_addr</tt> parameter specifies the minimum virtual

  address that a process is allowed to mmap. Allowing a process to mmap low

  portion of virtual memory can have security implications such as such as

  heightened risk of kernel null pointer dereference defects.'
