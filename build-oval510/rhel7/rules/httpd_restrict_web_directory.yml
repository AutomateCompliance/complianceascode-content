description: "The default configuration for the web (<tt>/var/www/html</tt>) Directory\
  \ allows directory\nindexing (<tt>Indexes</tt>) and the following of symbolic links\
  \ (<tt>FollowSymLinks</tt>).\nNeither of these is recommended.\n<br /><br />\nThe\
  \ <tt>/var/www/html</tt> directory hierarchy should not be viewable via the web,\
  \ and\nsymlinks should only be followed if the owner of the symlink also owns the\
  \ linked file.\n<br /><br />\nEnsure that this policy is adhered to by altering\
  \ the related section of the configuration:\n<pre>&lt;Directory \"/var/www/html\"\
  &gt;\n#  ...\n   Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatch\n#  ...\n&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>"
