description: 'All accessible web directories should be configured with similarly restrictive
  settings.

  The <tt>Options</tt> directive should be limited to necessary functionality and
  the <tt>AllowOverride</tt>

  directive should be used only if needed. The <tt>Order</tt> and <tt>Deny</tt> access
  control tags

  should be used to deny access by default, allowing access only where necessary.'
