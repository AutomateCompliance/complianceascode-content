description: 'By default, no <tt>exception.sites</tt> file exists which means that
  there is no prevention of

  unauthorized software. The <tt>exception.sites</tt> file is a text file containing
  single-line URLs for

  accepted risk sites. If the Java accepted sites list file does not exist, it can
  be added

  by running:

  <pre>$ sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/.java/deployment

  $ sudo touch /etc/.java/deployment/exception.sites

  $ sudo chmod 644 /etc/.java/deployment/exception.sites</pre>'

  decreases risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities.'
