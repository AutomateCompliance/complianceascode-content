rationale: 'Each option in the Java control panel is represented by property keys.

  These keys adjust the options in the Java control panel based on the value

  assigned to that key. By default no deployment.properties file exists; thus,

  no system-wide deployment exists. Without the deployment.properties file, setting
  particular

  options for the Java control panel is impossible.'
