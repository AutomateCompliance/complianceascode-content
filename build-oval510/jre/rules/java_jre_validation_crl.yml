rationale: 'A certificate revocation list is a directory which contains a list of

  certificates that have been revoked for various reasons. Certificates may be

  revoked due to improper issuance, compromise of the certificate, and failure

  to adhere to policy. Therefore, any certificate found on a CRL should not be

  trusted. Permitting execution of an applet published with a revoked

  certificate may result in spoofing, malware, system modification, invasion

  of privacy, and denial of service.'
