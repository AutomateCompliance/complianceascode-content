description: 'When a browser is started the first web page displayed is the "home
  page".

  While the home page can be selected by the user, the default home page needs

  to be defined to display an approved page. To set the default home page,

  set <tt>HomepageLocation</tt> to <tt><sub idref="var_trusted_home_page" /></tt>

  in the Chromium policy file.'
