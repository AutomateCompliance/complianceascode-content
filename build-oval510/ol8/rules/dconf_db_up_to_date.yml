rationale: 'Unlike text-based keyfiles, the binary database is impossible to check
  by OVAL.

  Therefore, in order to evaluate dconf configuration, both have to be true at the

  configuration files have to be compliant, and the database needs to be more recent
  than those keyfiles,

  which gives confidence that it reflects them.'
